Unit 1 PROJECT

This is my first go at building a Portfolio website. This stretched my skill in HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.


Technologies used:

All the content seen  is pretty much done with HTML and CSS Flexbox.

The buttons for changing the color theme are work through jQuery and each button calls a different function that changes the color of the elements as well as put a white border around the button that is active and remove the border from the previously active button.

The read more/less button on the bio is toggling class on and off on that div that show or hides the content. There's also an if statement in that function that checks if the class is on then the button will say "Read Less" if the class is not there it'll say 'Read More'.

On the contacts page, when the user clicks on the send button a modal will pop up saying that the message was sent. This is very similar to how Nolo showed us how to make a modal.

On the Projects Page there is a carousel that goes through pictures of some work I've done since the start of the bootcamp. This is also very similar to how Jesse showed how to do the carousel.

For the Bio and resume sections of the page, those t2o sections are found scrolling down from the home page. If you click on the links on the nav for them, they will jump to their respective section. This will work the same even if you're clicking on those links from a different page.

The Namecard and the header/Nav are both sticky. The home page and projects page are pretty much to long container one beside the other. the left one only has the namecard and the rest of the container serves as a rail of sorts for the name card to traverse as a sticky element when scrolling down the page. The right container hold all the other segments within it. At the bottom of the page there is a button the returns to the top of the page and it works the same as the links in the nav bar do.





////////////////Issues i didn't have time to figure outline

Mainly how to change things that happen during a hover. Like changing the color of the hover shadow on the nav bar once the color of the webpage is changed. I couldn't change the color of the hover effects. 

I would have liked to have the contacts page actually send a message but at this time it was a bit over my head plsu there was other stuff i needed to spend more time on.

Another issues is when using the website on a mobile device, things like hover effects and buttons that change color on click stayed stuck with the hover effect or color change.
